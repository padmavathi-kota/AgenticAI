# 🚚 **Late Delivery Policy**

*Last updated: {{DATE}}*

We strive to ensure timely delivery of all orders placed on our platform. However, delays may occur due to operational, environmental, or traffic-related factors. This Late Delivery Policy explains how late deliveries are handled and what customers may expect in such situations.

---

## 📌 **1. What Counts as “Late Delivery”?**

A delivery is considered **late** when:

* The order is delivered **significantly beyond** the estimated delivery time shown at checkout, and
* The delay is caused by issues under our platform’s or delivery partner’s control.

Examples of valid late delivery scenarios:

* Delay due to delivery partner assignment issues
* Delay caused by technical or logistical problems
* Delay due to restaurant preparation taking longer than usual

---

## 📌 **2. Situations NOT Counted as Late Delivery**

Late delivery due to the following does **not** qualify for compensation:

* Severe traffic congestion
* Extreme weather (rainstorms, floods, heat waves)
* Public events or roadblocks
* Incorrect delivery address provided by customer
* Customer being unreachable by phone
* Building entry restrictions or security delays

---

## 📌 **3. Compensation for Late Delivery**

When eligible, customers may receive:

### **3.1 Delivery Fee Refund**

In cases of platform or partner-related delays, customers may receive:

* **Full refund** of the delivery fee, or
* **Waived delivery fee** on a future order (via coupon/credit)

### **3.2 Platform Credits**

For moderate delays, customers may receive:

* Promotional credits
* Discount vouchers
* Free delivery tokens

### **3.3 Partial Refund (Case-by-Case)**

If the delay significantly affects the quality or usability of the order (e.g., melted dessert, cold food), a partial refund may be granted after review.

## 📌 **4. How to Raise a Late Delivery Issue**

Customers can report late deliveries through the **Help & Support** section:

1. Select the affected order
2. Choose **“Late Delivery”**
3. Provide additional details if required

Support may verify:

* Actual delivery time
* Route taken by delivery partner
* Relevant operational logs

---

## 📌 **5. Eligibility Review**

Refunds/compensation are assessed based on:

* Extent of delay
* Reason for delay
* Order history and issue patterns
* Platform logs and restaurant/delivery partner updates

Our moderation team may decline requests if misuse or fraudulent claims are detected.

---

## 📌 **6. Delivery Partner Delays**

Delays caused unintentionally by delivery partners—such as navigation errors, bike issues, or rerouting—may still qualify for compensation, depending on severity.

However, repeated wrongful claims against delivery partners may lead to account restrictions.

---

## 📌 **7. Restaurant Preparation Delays**

If a restaurant takes longer than expected to prepare food, compensation may be provided based on:

* Restaurant performance history
* Severity of delay
* Impact on customer experience

---

## 📌 **8. Exclusions**

The platform is not responsible for delays due to:

* Unavoidable circumstances (weather, strikes, natural calamities)
* Peak-hour congestion beyond control
* Government restrictions or local regulations

---

## 📌 **9. Policy Misuse**

We may deny compensation if:

* Customer repeatedly reports late delivery without basis
* Evidence contradicts the claim
* Order was delivered within acceptable time ranges

Misuse may lead to warnings, credit removal, or account suspension.
